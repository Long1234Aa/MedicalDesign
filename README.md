# Syringe Pump Project

## Introduction  
This project focuses on designing and implementing a **syringe pump**. The syringe pump is an essential medical device used for accurate and controlled delivery of fluids, medications, or nutrients into a patient's body. Our project aims to create a cost-effective, reliable, and user-friendly syringe pump suitable for various medical and laboratory applications.
